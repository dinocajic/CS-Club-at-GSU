            <p class="text-center wow fadeInDown">The main purpose of the Computer Science Club is to get individuals excited about their discipline. Each CS club member has more knowledge than others in a particular area. We want to make sure that our knowledge is combined and that we have a close network of people that we can turn to when concepts need further explanation.</p>
